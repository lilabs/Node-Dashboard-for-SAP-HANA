Install Requirements
----

1. SAP HANA Instance (e.g. AWS Developer Image)
2. Node.js installed (this does not need to be on the HANA box but same network with access to the HANA port - normally 30015).

Node Dependencies

We will also use a couple of helpful dependencies from the node community including: 
- Socket.io
- Express and 
- hdb 
 
Installing these packages is as simple as running "npm install hdb‚Äù. Once you have the dependencies installed we can start creating our app.
